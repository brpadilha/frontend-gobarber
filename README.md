# About this project

This is a private repository with all my notes and GoBarber React Frontend application code where it consumes the GoBarber API found [here](https://github.com/brpadilha/backend-gobarber) created with NodeJS. This application was used JWT authentication where it receives an authentication token from Api to be able to browse. The authentication is stored in Redux so that whenever the user is logged in, we will have access to Name, Avatar, and their calendar.

This front end is part of the application's Provider, which would be the barber, where it would show your schedule.
